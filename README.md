# hello-world
Coming to a dank river valley near you

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an 'L' on her forehead. Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming, fed to the rules and I hit the ground running. Didn't make sense not to live for fun, your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with takin' the backstreets? You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you don't glow.
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play. Hey now, you're a rockstar, get the show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars break the mold.
